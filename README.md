I created a modern, responsive landing page for Vero, a fictional online bank, as a front-end development practice. The page highlights Vero’s key features, like secure transactions, low fees, and 24/7 support, while focusing on clean design and usability.

It includes:
	•	A hero section with an eye-catching headline and call-to-action buttons.
	•	Service highlights to showcase the bank’s benefits.
	•	Responsive design for seamless viewing across all devices.
	•	Smooth animations and interactive elements to enhance user experience.

I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean, maintainable code and delivering a visually appealing, professional layout.
